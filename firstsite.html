<p> I was born on March 9th 2002, right before my twin brother. We were born in Arizona and as my sister Leslie likes to remind us we are the reason our mom missed the soccer game. It is a story I have heard for the past 22 years and I will continue to hear until time ends. Leslie is a cool sister and someone I have always looked up to. She is an amazing artist and there is one piece she has where the pears are all different colors that comes to mind. We both loved Soul Surfer and she made me art in honor of that shared bond. </p>
