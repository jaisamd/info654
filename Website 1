<P>Carpenters is a duo started in 1968 and were credited with hit songs like We've Only Just Begun, Close To You, Top of the World, Rainy Days and Mondays and much more. I first became interested in them when my grandpa said he had grown up next to them. It was something he had mentioned several times throughout my childhood. Once I listened to A Song For You I was hooked. The lyrics I love you in place where there is no space or time moved me. The guitar solo in Goodbye to Love that would be marked controversial was something I sang too. Carpenteres have become such a large part of the me. Anyone silly enough to call themself my friend knows how deep my love for Carpenters go. In fact I one day hope to get the name tattooed as it appears in the same font in the same position throughout every album. The colors may be different and the stories in the album may change but they never do. </P>
