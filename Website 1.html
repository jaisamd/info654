    <p>Carpenters is a duo that started in 1968 and was credited with hit songs like "We've Only Just Begun," "Close To You," "Top of the World," "Rainy Days and Mondays," and many more. I first became interested in them when my grandpa mentioned he had grown up next to them, something he repeated several times throughout my childhood. Once I listened to "A Song For You," I was hooked. The lyrics, "I love you in a place where there is no space or time," moved me deeply. The controversial guitar solo in "Goodbye to Love" was something I sang along to. Carpenters have become a significant part of my life. Anyone foolish enough to call themselves my friend knows how profound my love for Carpenters goes. In fact, I hope to someday get their name tattooed in the same font, in the same position, as it appears across their albums. The colors may vary, and the stories in the albums may change, but the essence remains the same.</p>
