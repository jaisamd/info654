<p>Sasuke Uchiha is a character in the Naruto franchise. He is in a team alongside the titular character as well as Sakura Haruno and Kakashi Hatake. Most teams in Naruto are made up of 2 guys and 1 girl. In his year there are 2 other groups but as the show continues we become acquanited with a group a year older. Sasuke is introduced early on in the show and he is the blueprint for characters with dark hair and moody attitudes. As anime progresses beyond Sasuke he is oftentimes the reference point of if a character can be as moody. One of his most iconic quotes is My name is Sasuke Uchiha. I hate a lot of things and I don't particularly like anything. What I have is not a dream, because I will make it a reality. I'm going to restore my clan and destroy a certain somebody. The certain somebody being his brother. Itachi Uchiha famous for killing his entire clan which of course included Sasuke's parents, cousins, uncles and anyone cursed enough to have the power of the Sharingan. Itachi was tasked by the government to kill his family and he vowed to as long as Sasuke his beloved brother could stay alive. The night of the killings Itachi told Sasuke to foster his hatred for Itachi and train to kill him. Of course Sasuke was unaware that Itachi was dying and that when the time came to kill him, Itachi's body would be near decay despite being alive.</p>

<p> Sasuke joined team 7 after graduating the ninja academy. He was placed alongside Naruto because of their opposing grades. Sasuke was one of the 2 geinuses and the fact Naruto passed is a shock. Sakura was also among the smarter in the class and was expected to pick up the slack of the rivalry between Sasuke and Naruto a task she would do until the end of Shippuden. After fighting Zabuza and almost losing to Haku, Sasuke was saved by Naruto and vowed to get stronger. When it was time to pass on to the Chunin exams, the village criminal Orochimaru promised Sasuke a way to become stronger and one day Sasuke would leave the village with hopes of becoming strong enough to defeat the dastardly Itachi. After killing Orochimaru, Sasuke would create team Taka with the goal of killing Itachi and also destroying his village.</p>

<p> Later Sasuke would join the Akatsuki a terrorist organization that was intent on collecting tailed beasts in order to create an infinte tsukyomi which would put people in their desired dreams. Of course this would include killing Naruto which is something Sauske was set on doing because Naruto made him feel peace and that was not something he could feel if he wanted to change the world. </p>

<p>Ultimately Sasuke and Naruto would fight for their lives against each other. One losing a right arm and one losing a left. Sasuke would give up his dreams of demolishing Konoha but he would assist Naruto and become his Shadow Hokage doing the dirtier work that would make the world a cleanrer place.</p>
